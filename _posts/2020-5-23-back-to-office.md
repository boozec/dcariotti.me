title: Back to the office
---

This week has been different than others, 'cause I finally back to the office.

I'm enthusiast for this except for a few things:
* I started to design a fucking website in Wordpress (oh man, I'm not a fucking webdesigner)
* a hated customer with his damned ecommerce written in Laravel
* I'm a bit cooled ü§í

Ok, I've to do some notes about these words:
1. I've nothing versus webdesigner, but I study algorithms, fucking Assembly language, data structures, fucking Assembly language, crypthography, fucking Assembly language, natural languages, fucking Assembly language, database and what do u me make me do? a website in Wordpress? üò°.
2. I don't want spend other of my time to talk 'bout this project written in Laravel, but I finally fix all bugs he wanted to fix and I'll not say no more words 'bout it... **NOW**.
3. I don't have coronavirus, or at least I hope so.

## University

I'm just a little behind the study compared than my classmates, and I've not
started two courses yet, but I'm really optimistic to finish everything in
december. And then I'll start courses of the second year (oh yeah...).

I finally create a perfect `.vimrc`, `.tmux`, `.zsh` files. I love VIM, I write code
everytime faster than before.

I started to watch some online courses: _Algorithms and Data structures_ by
[University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), _Linear Algebra
applied to Machine Learning_ by [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (London.. but the lecturer talks about Euro
instead of Pounds.. don't ask me why oh) and _AWS_ (yeah, finally I'm going to
learn the Amazon fucking Web fucking Services).
Remember when I decided to [learn Rust](/blog/2020/04/13/first-code-in-rust/)? I
don't write anything in Rust since then. I really kinda suck, but I don't have
much time to do everything.
I've so many things to study that I didn't know how to start so I decided to
write this post instead of study (in real sense); for my parents I'm a genius üòÅ.

PS: We're talking about VIM, so I want to share this topic posted on Reddit 2
years ago:

PS2: This is how my VIM looks like. I'm studing Programming II on this screenshot, so we could say I'm a
really good student.
