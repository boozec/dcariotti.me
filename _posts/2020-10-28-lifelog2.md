## University

I also know that I've forgotten to write an article in the last 3 weeks but the truth is: my life is a monotonous and boring cycle.

I mean, I wake up, university lessons, gym, eat, work, eat, study, sleep.
FINISHED.

It's a fuuucking boring cycle or at least It was until last week 'cause I
work remotely again and gyms are closed (thx u so much 'mbare Peppe). Now I don't get
out home, I cannot even have a beer after work :(

This academic year, however, seems difficult: I don't know if because I still
have three exams from last year or because I don't want to stay at home. I would
rather travel the world but I can't and that bothers me.

## Job
I'm developing more and more and more boring stuff but there's something good
about all this story: missing 2 months at Christmas and this means salary x2!

I'm considering to switching to Debian but not before Christmas holidays.

`Sentence about Debian could also be considered in the university, job and life sections`

## Life
I read one book: _The Sorrows of Young Werther_, maybe next time I'll write a
little comment about it. I've started _White Nights_ but free time to read is
less and less. Anyway stop complaining! I'm kiddin', just a bit tired. I just
want to have a cold beer in my favourite pub. I miss Instagram so here is a pic of Ric and
Cl√† studying last week.
