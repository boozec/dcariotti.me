This is the first post of the year, so...
### Happy new year!

It's socially accepted to say this until february!

Yesterday was the first day of the red-zone, or almost, of the red-zone for Sicily. Yes,
my island is officially in lockdown. A lockdown like march 2020 except for barbers.

I thought i forgot to write a mini-review of my advent
calendar. My gf gave me a personalized-advent-calendar for last Christmas.
Something really original, if you think that I gave her a game for the
Nintendo, I'm the worst bf ever.

Anyway, here we have a list, starting december 9th:
* 🍵 tea: ginger and cinnamon (one of my favs)
* 🕯️ candle: vin brulè taste (**in love**)
* 🍺 beer: finding a Gusiness around my city is hard
* nougat: pistacchio
* 🍺 beer: another beer, belgian this time
* earphones: bluetooth earphones for me are now revolutionaries
* 🎅 chocolate Santa Claus: meh :/
* 🍺 beer: another beer, she knows me
* ☕ cup: a cup for tea with a big mustache
* christmas ball: inside there were sweeties
* beer undewear: **no words about it**
* 🍺 beer: punk ipa, i love it!
* 📚 book: Fight club by _Chuck Palahniuk_
* water bottle: thanks, i needed it for trekking
* 🛋️ lamp: IKEA lamp for my desk
* 🏦 piggy bank: where i can save for our trips!

I don't have a favourite and I think there's bad to say something like this, but
the _beer underwear_ was my lucky charm for the __Linear algebra and geometry__
exam: maybe without it i wouldn't have got A+.

Now I run to study for the next `n` exams. See ya in february (or march).
