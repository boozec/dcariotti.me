## Who I am
![me.jpg](/i/me.jpg)

Hello, I am __Santo__ and I'm a software engineer and computer science
student at University of Catania.

Maybe, saying "software engineer" is a word too big, but I started to hack the
internet since I was 10, and I will never stop to thank my parents for "installing"
Internet in my home. In those years Internet was something really new for me and
my classmates.

I started with PHP, such a lovely script language used for MMORPG fansites. I
had to start somewhere, don't you think? I hacked in many languages before starting work.
Now I'm casting curses in Python/JS for work and C++ and Rust for love.

Anynway, I'm a beer lover (as you can see from the picture above page) and an amateur cook. You can see the places (restaurants and pubs) I
visited [here](/pubs).

I'm also a cinephile, or almost, I was before to start the university. Time is
always less and less, but I'm tracking (since november, 2020) the movies I
watch. The list is [here](/movies).

Since june 2020 I have become aware of the privacy issues of many softwares and
architectures we use everyday. I moved in a privacy-direction also thanks to
[Tor](https://torproject.org) and [Signal](https://signal.org), proceeding in a
[degoogling](https://reddit.com/r/degoogle) way.

In the grey section you can contact me in many and many ways, so It's useless
rewrite those links here. But, if you want to touch me intimately (don't think
dirty) you can contact me at __santo at dcariotti dot me__. Just replace "at"
and "dot" and you'll find my email. My GPG key is `C9B7 C8FD 3701 C2C6`.
