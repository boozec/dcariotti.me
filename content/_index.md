## Who I am

![me.jpg](/i/me.jpg)

Hello, I am **Santo**, a SWE and a computer science student graduated from the [University of Catania](https://dmi.unict.it) and
enrolled in a Master's degree program at the [University of Bologna](https://cs.unibo.it).

Started with PHP and C, now I'm studying Rust and OCaml.

I'm a beer lover (as you can see from the picture above page) and an amateur cook.

I'm also a cinephile! Well, I was before the university. Time is
always less and less, but I'm [tracking](/movies) (since november, 2020) the movies I
watch.

In the grey section you can contact me in many and many ways, so It's useless
rewrite those links here. But, if you want to touch me intimately (don't think
dirty) you can contact me at _santo [at] dcariotti [dot] me_.
Here it is [my key](/public.pgp) and my fingerprint `F422 EE52 8943 260C 5632 C1A5 C9B7 C8FD 3701 C2C6`.
