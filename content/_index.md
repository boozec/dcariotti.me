## Who I am

![me.jpg](/i/me.jpg)

Hello, I am **Santo** and I'm a software engineer (or I like say that) and computer
science student at University of Catania.

I started with PHP, such a lovely script language used by me for MMORPG fansites.
I hacked in many languages before starting work. Now I'm focusing Python/JS for
work and C++ and Rust for love.

I'm a beer lover (as you can see from the picture above page) and an amateur cook.

I'm also a cinephile, or almost, I was before the university. Time is
always less and less, but I'm tracking (since november, 2020) the movies I
watch. The list is [here](/movies).

Since june 2020 I have become aware of the privacy issues of many softwares and
architectures we use everyday. I moved in a privacy-direction also thanks to
[Tor](https://torproject.org) and [Signal](https://signal.org).

In the grey section you can contact me in many and many ways, so It's useless
rewrite those links here. But, if you want to touch me intimately (don't think
dirty) you can contact me at _santo [at] dcariotti [dot] me_.
Here it is [my key](/public.pgp) and my fingerprint `F422 EE52 8943 260C 5632 C1A5 C9B7 C8FD 3701 C2C6`.
