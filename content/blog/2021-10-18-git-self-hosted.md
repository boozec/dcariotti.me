title: Own GitHub

It's a clickbait because I don't have my own GitHub, but a
[Cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) instance and you can reach it at
[git.dcariotti.me](http://git.dcariotti.me)

Now I'm moving my notes and software that does not care about Issues/PR/Wiki/CI
etc. Why am I moving these things from GitHub to my Cgit?
1. Nobody cares about that kind of code;
2. Cgit as a backup for no more used code;
3. Opensource is always better;
4. Why not?

Open source projects used with Issues (and etc.) and contributions still remain
on my GitHub. Same for this website for now!

Btw, the last post on this blog was in february. `Lifelog`s will return
sooner or later (maybe).
