title: Own GitHub

It's a clickbait because I don't have my own GitHub, but a [Cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) instance. You can find it at [git.dcariotti.me](http://git.dcariotti.me).

I'm currently moving my notes and software that don't need Issues, PRs, Wikis, CI, etc., from GitHub to my Cgit. Why am I doing this?

1. Nobody cares about that kind of code.
2. Cgit serves as a backup for unused code.
3. Open source is always better (?).
4. Why not?  

Open-source projects that rely on Issues (and the like) and contributions will still remain on my GitHub. The same applies to this websiteâ€”for now!

Btw, the last post on this blog was back in February. `Lifelog`s will return sooner or later (maybe).
