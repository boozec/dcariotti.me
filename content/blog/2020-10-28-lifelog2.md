Yeah, I purchased a domain and put this site on. Welcome to [https://dcariotti.me](https://dcariotti.me)

## University

I also know that I've forgotten to write an article in the last 3 weeks, but the truth is: my life is a monotonous and boring cycle.

I mean, I wake up, university lessons, gym, eat, work, eat, study, sleep. 
FINISHED.

It's a fucking boring cycle, or at least it was until last week because I work remotely again and gyms are closed (thanks so much, 'mbare Peppe). Now I don't get out of home, I cannot even have a beer after work :(

This academic year, however, seems difficult: I don't know if it's because I still have three exams from last year or because I don't want to stay at home. I would rather travel the world, but I can't, and that bothers me.

## Job

I'm developing more and more boring stuff, but there's something good about all this: only 2 months until Christmas, and this means salary x2!

I'm considering switching to Debian, but not before Christmas holidays. (Sentence about Debian could also be considered in the university, job, and life sections)

## Life

I read one book: *The Sorrows of Young Werther*, maybe next time I'll write a little comment about it. I've started *White Nights*, but free time to read is less and less. Anyway, stop complaining! I'm kidding, just a bit tired. I just want to have a cold beer in my favorite pub. I miss Instagram, so here is a pic of Ric and Cl√† studying last week.
