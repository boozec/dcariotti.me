This is the first post of the year, so...

### Happy New Year!

It's socially accepted to say this until February!

Yesterday was the first day of the red zone, or almost, of the red zone for Sicily. Yes, my island is officially in lockdown. A lockdown like March 2020, except for barbers.

I thought I forgot to write a mini-review of my advent calendar. My gf gave me a personalized advent calendar for last Christmas. Something really original, if you think that I gave her a game for the Nintendo. I'm the worst boyfriend ever.

Anyway, here we have a list, starting december 9th:

* 🍵 Tea: ginger and cinnamon (one of my favorites)
* 🕯️ Candle: vin brulè taste (**in love**)
* 🍺 Beer: finding a Guinness around my city is hard
* Nougat: pistachio
* 🍺 Beer: another beer, Belgian this time
* Earphones: Bluetooth earphones for me are now revolutionary
* 🎅 Chocolate Santa Claus: meh :/
* 🍺 Beer: another beer, she knows me
* ☕ Cup: a cup for tea with a big mustache
* Christmas ball: inside there were sweets
* Beer underwear: **no words about it**
* 🍺 Beer: Punk IPA, I love it!
* 📚 Book: *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk
* Water bottle: thanks, I needed it for trekking
* 🛋️ Lamp: IKEA lamp for my desk
* 🏦 Piggy bank: where I can save for our trips!

I don't have a favorite and I think it's bad to say something like this, but the *beer underwear* was my lucky charm for the **Linear Algebra and Geometry** exam: maybe without it I wouldn't have gotten an A+.

Now I run to study for the next `n` exams. See ya in february (or march).
