I'm sober this Sunday: It's something strange and new, but I had to do. I'm kidding, eh.

Remember when I decided to uninstall Instagram from my iPhone? I do, of course I do. It's Reddit's turn. Nooo, I don't want to uninstall Reddit, but I'm spending a lot of time here.

I created an account about 4 years ago ([u/usantoc](https://www.reddit.com/user/usantoc)) and, since last week, I opened that website sometimes. Now, according to my iPhone app, I spend hours reading, scrolling, informing, and laughing on Reddit. And you want to know what? It's better than Instagram.

I don't watch soft-porn videos or stupid travel-and-ass-or-boobs pics from the Maldives.

I'm tired, but I'm doing my best to tell my fucking business to a PC (no one is forcing me to do this, but I want to). However, it's not the time for now, sooooo, take this post and do it enough for this week, bye.

`:wq`
