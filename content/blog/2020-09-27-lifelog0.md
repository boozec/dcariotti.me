This is my first Life Log - a weekly (or monthly, I haven't decided yet) post where I tell about my life to the whole internet instead of sharing my business through social networks.

Yeah, I have to confess that I watched [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81254224) and that's one of the reasons for my "unsocialnetworking". I only uninstalled Facebook and Instagram: in one week I saved 4-5 hours of my life, my mental sanity, and around 200 notifications. Facebook reminds me, every damn day, about my 424242 notifications not seen from 424242 events I don't care about.

I'm studying more and more and planning an escape. Maybe to the Caribbean Islands or New Zealand. I don't hate Sicily, but oh my god, I'm getting more stressed every day. As my gf says: "This is just a little, normal, daily mental breakdown". So let me complain, in particular about the 40â‚¬ spent yesterday on alcohol. Ric, if you are reading these words, I hate you!

The reality is I like being a programmer with a love for cooking and porn (these two things are not related, don't think badly)... and I love my city. Just, all of us want the things that we don't have. In my case: I'd want to see the Danube River from the window of a Tesla, while drinking a beer bought at Szimpla Kert.

PS: I'm also improving my English, because I'd like to be a fashion blogger and this blog is just the beginning of a brilliant career.

However, now I'm saving these words on the internet and quitting because I'm not really sober yet.
