This week has been different from others because I finally went back to the office.

I'm excited about this, except for a few things:
- I started to design a website in WordPress (oh man, I'm not a web designer).
- A hated customer with his damned e-commerce site written in Laravel.
- I'm feeling a bit under the weather ü§í.

Okay, here are some notes about these issues:

1. I have nothing against web designers, but I study algorithms, fuckin' Assembly language, data structures, fuckin' Assembly language, cryptography, fuckin' Assembly language, databases... and what do they make me do? A website in WordPress? üò°.

2. I don't want to spend any more time talking about this project in Laravel, but I finally fixed all the bugs he wanted fixed. That's all I have to say about it... **FOR NOW**.

3. I don't have coronavirus‚Äîor at least I hope not.

## University

I'm just a little behind in my studies compared to my classmates, and I haven't started two courses yet. However, I'm optimistic about finishing everything by december. After that, I'll move on to second-year courses (oh yeah...).

I finally created the perfect `.vimrc`, `.tmux`, and `.zsh` configuration files. I love VIM, and I'm writing code faster than ever.

I also started watching some online courses:
- _Algorithms and Data Structures_ by [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/).
- _Linear Algebra Applied to Machine Learning_ by [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (London... but the lecturer talks about Euros instead of Pounds. Don't ask me why).
- _AWS_ (yeah, finally learning Amazon Web Services).

Remember when I decided to [learn Rust](/blog/2020/04/13/first-code-in-rust/)? Well, I haven't written anything in Rust since then. I know, I kind of suck, but I don't have much time to do everything.

I have so many things to study that I didn't know where to start. So, I decided to write this post instead of studying (yeah, really). To my parents, I'm a genius üòÅ.

**PS:** Since we're talking about VIM, I want to share this Reddit post from 2 years ago:

**PS2:** This is how my VIM setup looks. I'm studying Programming II in this screenshot, so we could say I'm a pretty good student.
**Study + procrastination = üòé** _(If you didn't catch it, that's me with sunglasses)_
