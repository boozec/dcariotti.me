Thanks to Black Friday (and remote working), I finally bought an external keyboard and mouse for my new desk.

## Reality

I took an old desk and moved it to my room. It was okay except for my long legs and a central drawer where my legs were constantly banging. I was forced to put my legs horizontally, a real agony for me. So I decided to buy a keyboard to connect to this laptop. It's a new thing for me because it's ergonomic, or, as I like to say to everyone: *split*.

I also bought a vertical mouse because it was uncomfortable to use both the external keyboard and integrated laptop touchpad.

> My back thanks.

## Emails Stuff

I have configured [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/) for my personal `@dcariotti.me` emails. I tried setting it up for my work email but without success. When it's easy to set up, I'll also integrate my `@gmail` email too.

I'm really appreciating the terminal email approach: easy to read and Mutt doesn't distract me. Obviously, I use this email first for **Debian** mailing list, so emails are few for now, but who knows?

There's one more thing: I have to study linear algebra, a *beautiful* course that I've been following since last year and which I postponed to January.

Feel the wonderful Christmas spirit of december 1st? Oh yes... vin brul√®, pandoro, tombola, unwelcome gifts, lots of love, and lots of stress.
