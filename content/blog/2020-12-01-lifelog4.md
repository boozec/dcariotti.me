title: lifelog 4 - new desk setup

Thanks to Black Friday (and remote working) i finally bought an external
keyboard and mouse for my new desk.

## Reality
I took an old desk and moved it to my room. It was ok except for my long
legs and a central drawer where my legs were constantly banging. I was forced to put
my legs horizontally, a real agony for me. So i decided to buy a keyboard to
connect it to   this laptopo. It's a new stuff for me 'cause it's ergonomic, or, as
i like to say to everyone: _splitted_.

I also bought a vertical mouse, 'cause it was uncomfortable to use both external
keyboard and integraded laptop touchpad.

> My back thanks.

## Emails stuff
I have configured [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/) for my personal `@dcariotti.me`
emails. I tried setting it also for my work email but without success. When it's
easy to set up i'll also integrate my `@gmail` email too.
I'm really appreciating the terminal email approach: easy to read and Mutt
doesn't distract me. Obviously, i use this email first for **Debian**
maillist so emails are a few for now but who knows?


There's one more thing: i have to study
linear algebra, a _beautiful_ course that i've been following since last year and which i
postponed to january.

Feel the wonderful Christmas spirit of december 1st? Oh yes... vin
brul√®, pandoro, tombola, unwelcome gifts, lots of love and lots of a lot of stress.
