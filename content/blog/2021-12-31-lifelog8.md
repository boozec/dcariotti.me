title: lifelog 8 - the second summary of the year
date: 2021-12-31

For the second year in a row, here I am, writing a summary of my year. This year, I've blogged twice, plus the time I wrote about my Cgit instance.

2020 feels like it was just yesterday and strangely similar, but this year has been more hectic. I've decided to divide this post into sections.

## Social

I'm not really a social blogger, so I use this blog to post my thoughts once a year. I should probably use something like Twitter or Mastodon to do this throughout the year in 120–140 character posts, but, you know, meh—I'm lazy.

I've officially deactivated my Facebook account. Why not delete it? Well, maybe I'll write about that decision in another blog post.

I'm using Twitch more and more, but I'm a nerd, so I use it for the `Software and Game Development` category—not really for its original purpose. I don't play games often, so watching others play games I don't know at all feels like a boring sport.

## Books & Movies

This year I've [watched 62 movies](/movies) and an unspecified number of TV series.
I also read a few books outside of my university studies. Recently, I finished reading [*A Philosophy of Software Design*](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php), which I really enjoyed, especially for its tips on writing better source code.

A friend gifted me [*Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers%3A_Principles%2C_Techniques%2C_and_Tools). It may not be very new, but it's a great place to start. Maybe next year, you'll hear about my own programming language!

I've read my OS class book three times this year, but I didn't get around to reading the online chapter on "how to start writing an operating system" because of other exams.

Two narrative books are not enough. In 2022, I'm aiming to improve that number!

## Travel

This year, I flew again! My gf and I visited Florence and Pisa.

The first time I saw the [Duomo of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral), I had a kind of [Stendhal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal_syndrome). Every time after that—about ~240,042 times—the feeling was the same 🙃.  

Pisa is incredibly affordable—a true university city. Below is a picture of the Math department.

You recognized the sticker, right? 😏

I've already planned some new destinations for next year 🥰.

## Nerd

I've mostly moved away from MATE. I still use some packages like Caja or Atril, but now I'm using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as my window manager. It's cleaner than GNOME 2, and I really like it. While I still have MATE on my laptop, I'm considering fully switching to i3 and removing the MATE packages I no longer use.

Here's a list of nerdy things I've done this year:

- Switched from VIM to NeoVim.
- Tried Fish shell but went back to Zsh.
- Deployed a [Cgit instance](/blog/git-self-hosted/).
- """Bought""" VMs from Oracle and DigitalOcean.
- Bought sticker prints of my tattoo.
- Improved my Rust skills by creating a Telegram bot, contributing to GitHub projects, completing a project for my Database class, and starting the [Advent of Code 2021](https://git.dcariotti.me/aoc2021/). (I'll tackle more days after the holidays!)
- Significantly improved my C skills thanks to my OS, Networks, and Distributed Systems classes.
- Started hacking microcontrollers.

Things I wanted to do but didn't:

- Create a package for Ubuntu/Debian (after reading all the documentation 😞).
- Learn more about Zig 😞.
- Dive deeper into OpenCL 😞.

Maybe next year!

## Good Proposals

A bachelor's degree would be really cool 😂!

I'd also like to return to a normal daily routine (safely, of course), complete the three "I wanted to do but didn't" items from the previous section, travel to new places, and post more on this blog—hopefully, someone will read these posts!

And, of course, world peace.

I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of things I didn't know where to put or didn't want to share on the internet because, you know, on the internet, nobody knows I'm a dog.

**PS:** 💉 yourself!
