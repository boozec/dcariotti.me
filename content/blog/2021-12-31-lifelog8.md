title: lifelog 8 - the second summary of the year
date: 2021-12-31
---

For the second year here I am, writing a summary of my year. I've blogged twice
this year + that time I wrote about my cgit instance.

2020 looks like yesterday and somewhat similar, but this year has been more
hectic. I've decided to devide this post into sections.

## Social

I'm not a really social blogger, so I use this blog to post my
thoughts once a year. I should use something like Twitter or Mastodon to do this
during the year, in post(s) of 120-140 chars but, you know, meh, I'm lazy.

I have officially deactivated my Facebook account. Why not delete? Well, maybe in
another blog post I'll write about this decision.

I use Twitch every day more, but I'm a nerd, so I use it for `Software and game development`
category, not really for the original scope of the platform. I don't play games often
so I think watching other people play games I don't know at all is a boring
sport.

## Books & Movies

This year I've [watched 62 movies](/movies) and a number of tv series not really
specified anywhere.
I also read some books, extras from my university classes. I recently finished
reading [A philosophy of software
design](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php) and really
enjoyed reading it, most of all for all the tips for a good sourcecode.
A friend gifted me [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and
Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers%3A_Principles%2C_Techniques%2C_and_Tools)
maybe not very young but it's something good to start. Maybe next year
you'll read about my own programming language.

This year I read my OS class book about 3 times. But I also wanted read the
online chapter about "how to start writing an operating system" but I did not
'cause other exams.

2 narrative books are not enough so, in 2022, I want to improve this number!

## Travel

This year I flew again! I've been, with my gf, in Florence and Pisa.

I remembed that first time I saw the [Duomo
of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral) I had a kind of
[Stendhal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal_syndrome). The next ~240042
times I saw it, the feeling was the same üôÉ.

Pisa is really cheap. A true university city. This below is a picture of
the Math department.

You recognized the sticker, right? üòè

I've already planned some new destinations for the next year ü•∞.

## Nerd

I do not use MATE anymore, or almost, I use its packages like Caja or Atril, but
now I'm using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) WM. It's cleaner than GNOME 2 and I
really like this. Of course I've also MATE in this laptop but I'm thinking of
moving completely to i3 removing the MATE packages I don't use.

Here a list of nerd things I've done:

- I changed VIM to NeoVim.
- I tried Fish shell and back to zsh.
- I've deployed a [cgit instance](/blog/git-self-hosted/).
- I """bought""" VMs from Oracle and DigitalOcean.
- I bought sticker prints of my tattoo.
- I improved my Rust by doing a Telegram bot, some contributions on Github
  projects, a project for my Database class and started the [AoC
  2021](https://git.dcariotti.me/aoc2021/) (after the holidays I'll check other
  days and try to resolve them).
- I've really improved my C thanks to my OS, Networks and Distributed Systems
  classes.
- I've started hacking microcontrollers.

Something I wanted to do but I didn't:

- A package for Ubuntu/Debian after reading all the documentation üòû.
- Read more about Zig üòû.
- Read more about OpenCL üòû.

Maybe next year!

## Good Proposals

A bachelor degree would be really cool üòÇ!

I'd like to get back to normal every day more (safely of course). Do the
three "I wanted to do but I didn't" things from the previous section. Travel
and discover new places. And post more on this blog, hoping someone will read
the posts.

And, of course, world peace.

I obviously conclude by forgetting a lot of things that I don't know where to
put in these sections or that I don't want to share on the Internet, because,
you know, on the Internet, nobody knows I'm a dog.

PS: üíâ yourself!
