title: first code in Rust

Today I woke up with a thought: learn Rust. I bought a book about 3 months ago and I started to read it, read code on GitHub etc but I never wrote a code by myself.
After 1 hour (yeah, I suck) I implemented a fibonacci sequence. I think I used every Rust tips, but idk.

This is the bad code I wrote but I'm very proud of it.

```rust
use std::mem;

fn fib(n: &mut i32) -> i32 {
    let mut a = 1;
    let mut b = 1;
    while *n > 1 {
        a += b;
        mem::swap(&mut a, &mut b);
        *n -= 1;
    }

    b
}
```

<p>This prints the first <span>\(N\)</span> numbers from the fibonacci code.</p>

```rust
println!("{}", fib(&mut N));
```

Maybe one day I'll look at this code and think:"WTF is that?!".
