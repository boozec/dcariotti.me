This log has become monthly rather than weekly but, of course, the week is boring
for everyone.

Last year (nov, 24th 2019) i was at Budapest, spending more time with my gf at
[GellÃ©rt thermal baths](http://www.gellertbath.hu/) and today i'm inundate by university exams. Thanks a lot
`Databases` and `Maths` classes.

My beard and hair are growing weird. I've a strange curiosity about
it, for this reason i've not yet decided to cut 'em.

## Nerd stuff
At work i'm testing things like [Sentry](sentry.io) and Dokku. I feel more a
real programmer when i use this type of software instead of taking an UI on
Adobe XD and putting the HTML/CSS/JS code inside a git repository.

I had the brilliant idea of installing Debian, again -.-".
I wiped the partition, increased it (it was only 80GB, fuck) and tried to
install it. Wasteful when i say that i spent 4 hours concluding nothing, damn
ethernet drive. I re-installed Ubuntu, but, this time, Ubuntu Mate! Nothing changed, just a couple
of GB saved.
I also re-structured my `gitconfig` file and generated a [GPG](gnupg.org) key,
so i can _firm_ my commits now. This looks like a pro for me.

## Boredom
I'm using Twitter now, more like a passive stupid procrastinating student than a
smart boy. But, what can i say about?! The reality is:

I'm not late for exams: i'm just lazy. I need to do something always different
to keep my curiosity and focus. Doing the same things more and more causes to
me a innate sense of boredom and discomfort. Maybe i'm weird or maybe i'm just human.

I want to share a pic of Budapest from last year, cause i realized that i don't miss
Budapest, i miss the curiosity of discover new stuff, and Budapest was.
